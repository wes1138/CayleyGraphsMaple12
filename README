Maple worksheet containing a procedure to draw the Cayley graph of a group.
Compatible with Maple 12. (It may work with other versions, but this is the
only version I have access to.) It uses lots of goodies which are built-in to
Maple, so the code is rather short.  A few examples of the output can be
found here:

The usage should be clear from the comments in the worksheet.  Just make sure
you re-load all of the statements before trying to run the procedure.
